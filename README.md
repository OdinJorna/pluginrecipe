# pluginrecipe


This plugin is a plugin that adds a way to input, store and display recipes in your Tiddlywiki. All the information of the recipe is stored in user-fields, so the template is higly customizable without the need to change every recipe.

## Features
* A input form to add recipes
* A nice presentation of the recipe
* The box around the ingrediÃ«nts list changes depending on the theme. It takes on the colour of the page-background. Try this out by changing the palette of this wiki.
By default, each recipe gets tagged 'Recipe'.
* A search function to search based on recipe title, author, portions, kitchen and source.

## Wishlist
* A UI to change the default tagging
* A UI to edit recipes. Currently, if you edit the ingredients in the field of a recipe, the formatting gets lost.

## Credits
The CSS for the recipe template is expanded upon from https://tobibeer.github.io/me/cook/#%24%3A%2F.tb%2Fstyles%2Fcook
